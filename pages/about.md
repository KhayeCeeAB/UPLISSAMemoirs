## About UP LISSA

The University of the Philippines Library and Information Science Students Association traces its roots back to The Library Club which was formed in 1922.
In 1961, the Institute of Library Science was formally established, and a year after, The Library Club members reorganized under the Institute as The Library Science Club.
In response to the need for student governance, The Library Science Club served as the Institute's Student Council in 1972.
As the Library Science Club continued to serve as the Student Council, the Library Science Association was organized in 1973.
In 1981, the Library Science Association was renamed as the Institute of Library Science Students' Association; and in 1983, the organization went on to be called as the Library and Information Science Students' Association.
In 2002, UP LISSA and the Institute of Library and Information Science Student Council parted ways to pursue differing objectives, with UP LISSA pursuing a more academic-centered goal.
